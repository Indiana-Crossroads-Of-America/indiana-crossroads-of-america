# I:COA Website Repository.

I: COA is developed using a lightweight framework that's able to run universally anywhere that has a CLI-interface *(Even NGINX) ;)*.

I: COA utilizes VUEJS, VUE-CLI, NPM, NODEJS and other frameworks to run. We are very proud of the product we're developing and are open for feedback.
