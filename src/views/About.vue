    <h1>What is Indiana: Crossroads of America?</h1>
    <p>
      Indiana: Crossroads of America is primarily a Discord community that's
      dedicated to bringing the people of Indiana together. We do this

    <h1>Why did we create this community?</h1>
    <div class="b">
      The Indiana: Crossroads of America community was founded when its creator
      realized such a community could help bring people from the state together,
      especially in this relatively new digital era.
